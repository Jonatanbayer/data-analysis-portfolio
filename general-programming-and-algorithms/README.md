# General Programming & Logic Projects

This category includes projects focused on **general programming,
logic, and problem-solving**, which are not directly related
to data analysis but demonstrate a solid foundation in Python.

These projects highlight my ability to:
- Apply programming logic effectively
- Build algorithmic solutions
- Work with data structures
- Write clean and organized code

## Concepts Covered
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- String and data manipulation
- Basic algorithms

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Category Objective
To demonstrate strong programming fundamentals,
which are essential for data analysis, automation,
and building more complex solutions.
